				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Constitutional discourse in both the academy and the public sphere has recently included quite a bit of talk about &quot;originalism.&quot; &#0160;But what about originalism&#39;s great historic rival, &quot;living constitutionalism?&quot; &#0160;What is living constitutionalism and how is it different from originalism? &#0160;A preliminary answer to that question can be offered in the form of a simple definition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Living Constitutionalism</em>: &#0160;Living constitutionalism is the view that the legal content of constitutional doctrine does and should change in response to changing circumstances and values.</p>
<p>This entry in the <em>Legal Theory Lexicon</em> will examine the history of living constitutionalism, discuss the question as to how and whether it differs from originalism, and briefly explore some of the main forms of contemporary academic living constitutionalism. &#0160;As always, the&#0160;<em>Lexicon&#0160;</em>provides a short introduction to a concept in legal theory for law students.</p>
<p><strong>The History of Living Constitutionalism</strong></p>
<p>The phrase “living constitutionalism” seems to be derived from the title of a book by Howard Lee McBain, <em>The Living Constitution</em>, first published in 1927.&#0160; This slim volume ranges across a variety of topics, and it was not intended as rigorous constitutional theory.&#0160; The following passage illustrates McBain’s notion of a living constitution:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“A word”, says Mr. Justice Holmes, “is the skin of a living thought.”&#0160; As applied to a living constitution the expression is particularly apt; for living skin is elastic, expansile, and is constantly being renewed.&#0160; The constitution of the United States contains only about six thousand word; but millions of words have been written by the courts in elucidation of the ideas these few words encase.</p>
<p>In 1936, Charles Beard echoed McBain’s title in an essay published in the <em>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</em>.&#0160; Beard wrote,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since most of the words and phrases dealing with the powers and the limits of government are vague and must in practice be interpreted by human beings, it follows that the Constitution as practice is a living thing. The document can be read at any moment.&#0160; What the judges and other expounders have said in the past can be discovered in thousands of printed pages.&#0160; From the records of history, we can get some idea of past practices under the instrument. But what the Constitution as practice is today is what citizens, judges, administrators, lawmakers, and those concerned with the execution of the laws do in bringing about changes in the relations of persons and property in the United States, or in preserving existing relations.&#0160; It is the living word and deed of living persons, positive where positive, and subject to their interpretation where open to variant readings. How could it be otherwise? How could intelligence, as distinguished from sophisticated interest, conceive the document as practice in any other terms?<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[</a></p>
<p>Another important formulation was provided by Charles Reich in his 1963 article, <em>Mr. Justice Black and the Living Constitution</em>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[I]n a dynamic society the Bill of Rights must keep changing in its application or lose even its original meaning. There is no such thing as a constitutional provision with a static meaning. If it stays the same while other provisions of the Constitution change and society itself changes, the provision will atrophy. That, indeed, is what has happened to some of the safeguards of the Bill of Rights. A constitutional provision can maintain its integrity only by moving in the same direction and at the same rate as the rest of society. In constitutions, constancy requires change.</p>
<p>And a fourth influential formulation of living constitutionalism was offered in 1986 by Justice William Brennan:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To remain faithful to the content of the Constitution, therefore, an approach to interpreting the text must account for the existence of the substantive value choices and must accept the ambiguity inherent in the effort to apply them to modern circumstances.&#0160; The Framers discerned fundamental principles through struggles against particular malefactions of the Crown: the struggle shapes the particular contours of the articulated principles.&#0160; But our acceptance of the fundamental principles has not and should not bind us to those precise, at times anachronistic, contours.</p>
<p>The opponents of living constitutionalism offered their own definitions: for example, in 1976, then Associate Justice William Rehnquist wrote <em>The Notion of a Living Constitution</em>, which explicitly criticized living constitutionalism and implicitly endorsed originalism based on the writings of the framers.&#0160;</p>
<p>Contemporary theorists continue to use the phrase in a variety of ways.&#0160; Adam Winker writes,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The pattern-- critiquing originalism, insisting that the interpretation of the constitutional text evolve to meet changed conditions in society, and pursuing reform through litigation strategies that made evolution central to judicial reasoning--has come to define modern living constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Nelson Lund characterizes “living constitutionalism” as the view that “the scope of a constitutional right is defined largely by judicial perceptions of current social mores.”</p>
<p>Like &quot;originalism,&quot; the term &quot;living constitutionalism&quot; is best viewed as the name for a family of theories, some of which are explored below. &#0160;Our next step is to explore the relationship between originalism and living constitutionalism.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Living Constitutionalism versus Originalism</strong></p>
<p>Like other theoretical terms, &quot;living constitutionalism&quot; and &quot;originalism&quot; have meanings that are disputed. &#0160;This means that some theorists are likely to offer definitions for these terms that make it true (as a matter of definition) that living constitutionalism and originalism are mutually exclusive, where as other theorists may embrace the possibility that some moderate forms of living constitutionalism are compatible with originalism. &#0160;The most prominent example of compatibilism is Jack Balkin&#39;s theory, which he explicated and defended in his book,&#0160;<em>Living Originalism</em>.</p>
<p>The following definitions of &quot;living constitutionalism&quot; and &quot;originalism&quot; illustrate the possibility of compatibilism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Originalism</em>: &#0160;A constitutional theory is &quot;originalist&quot; if it affirms (1) the fixation thesis (the linguistic meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time each provision is framed and ratified), and (2) the constraint principle (the fixed original meaning should constraint constitutional practice).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Living Constitutionalism</em>: A constitutional theory is &quot;living constitutionalist&quot; if it affirms that the legal content of constitutional doctrine does and should change in response to changing circumstances and values.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Nonoriginalism:&#0160;</em>A constitutional theory is &quot;nonoriginalist&quot; if it denies either the fixation thesis or the constraint principle.</p>
<p>Given these definitions, &quot;living originalism&quot; is a conceptual possibility if it is the case that the fixed original meaning of the constitutional text underdetermines at least some questions of constitutional doctrine. &#0160;Such underdetermination may occur if the constitution contains provisions that are vague or open textured. &#0160;Such provisions could be said to create &quot;construction zones,&quot; areas of doctrine where the linguistic meaning of the text would need to be supplemented by precisification or default rules. &#0160;Thus, if some living constitutionalists accept that the constitutional text is binding when it is clear, then they could embrace originalism as to some issues while affirming that constitutional doctrine should evolve with respect to others.</p>
<p>Many participants in debates about living constitutionalism and originalism seem to reject the idea of compatibilism.&#0160; One reason for such rejection may a dispute over the definitions of the terms &quot;living constitutionalism&quot; and &quot;originalism&quot; could be defined as mutually exclusive positions.&#0160; This way of carving up the conceptual space has the advantage that it puts the two views in opposition to each other.&#0160; To the extent that the definitions are contested, the result would be &quot;<a href="https://lsolum.typepad.com/legal_theory_lexicon/2017/04/legal-theory-lexicon-075-metalinguistic-negotiation.html">metalinguistic negotiation</a>,&quot; which is discussed in another&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Lexicon</em> entry.</p>
<p>While some constitutional theorists reject the idea of compatibilism for definitional reasons, others may oppose compatibilism onns the basis of substantive concerns.&#0160; For example, some originalists may embrace the proposition that the constitutional text is fully determinate and hence that embracing the constraint principle entails that constitutional doctrine does not change. &#0160;It is important to remember that this kind of determinacy does not entail the further conclusion that constitutional applications are fixed. &#0160;Thus, one can believe that the original meaning of the Second Amendment creates a rule that forbids government regulations that ban the possession of weapons that can be carried by a person, but reject the idea that the category of weapons is limited to weapons that existed in 1791 when the Second Amendment was adopted.</p>
<p>If you accept the definitions offered above, then compatibilism and hence &quot;living originalism&#39; is at least a conceptual possibility. &#0160;If you reject these definitions, the theories that affirm some elements of living constitutionalism and some elements of originalism might be called &quot;hybrid views.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Forms of Living Constitutionalism</strong></p>
<p>Given the highly abstract definition of &quot;living constitutionalism,&quot; is should not be surprising that there are many different versions. &#0160;Living constitutionalism is best viewed as a family of theories. &#0160;A full survey of the members of the family is too much for a&#0160;<em>Lexicon&#0160;</em>entry, but here are some of the most important members:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Constitutional Pluralism</em>: This is the view that law is a complex argumentative practice with plural forms of constitutional argument.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Moral Readings: </em>This is Ronald Dworkin’s theory, also called “law as integrity” or the “constructive interpretation” theory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Common Law Constitutionalism</em>: This is the view that the content of constitutional law should be determined by a common-law process.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Popular Constitutionalism</em>: This is the view that “We the People” can legitimately change the Constitution through processes such as transformative appointments that do not formally amend the text.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Multiple Meanings</em>: This is the view that the constitutional text has multiple linguistic meanings and that constitutional practice should choose between these meanings on a case by case basis.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Superlegislature</em>: This is the view that the Supreme Court should act as an ongoing committee of constitutional revision with the power to adopt amending constructions of the constitutional text on the basis of the same kinds of reasons that would be admissible in a constitutional convention.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Contemporary Meaning</em>: &#0160;This is the view that the meaning of the constitutional text does change and that it is the contemporary meaning and not the original meaning that should constraint constitutional practice. &#0160;Unlike other versions of living constitutionalism, this view denies the fixation thesis, but not the constraint principle.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thayerianism</em>: This is a family of views that require courts to defer to Congress, with three variants:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Constrained Thayerianism</u> is the view that courts should defer to Congress but that Congress itself should be constrained by the original meaning of the constitutional text.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Unconstrained Thayerianism</u> is the view that courts should defer to Congress and that Congress should have the constitutional power to revise the constitutional text, either by adopting amending legislation or by creating implicit amendments through ordinary statutes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Representation Reinforcement Thayerianism</u> is the view that courts should defer to Congress except when judicial review is necessary to preserve democracy, including protection of discreet and insular minorities and protection of democratic processes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Constitutional Antitheory</em>:&#0160; There are four views that are “antitheoretical” in the sense that they deny that constitutional practice should be guided by any normative theory, whether that theory be originalist or nonoriginalist:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Particularism</u> is the view that constitutional practice should be guided by salient situation-specific normative considerations in particular constitutional situations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Pragmatism</u> is the similar view, associated with Judge Richard Posner (and in a different form with Daniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry) that constitutional decisions should be made pragmatically on the basis of various normative considerations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Eclecticism</u> is the view that different judges should embrace different approaches to constitutional interpretation and construction, and that even a single judge should adopt different approaches on different occasions.&#0160;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><u>Opportunism</u> is the view that theoretical stances should be deployed strategically to achieve ideological or partisan goals.&#0160;</p>
<p>One of the things we learn from this brief survey is that there are important differences between the various forms of living constitutionalism. &#0160;Common law constitutionalism and Thayerianism are radically different from each other, and both of them is quite different from the moral readings approach. &#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Living constitutionalism&quot; is frequently invoked in debates about constitutional theory, but it is rarely defined in a precise way. &#0160;The aim of this&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Lexicon&#0160;</em>entry has been to give you a brief introduction to this important idea, its history, and some of the forms that it takes.</p>

				<p>The&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Bookworm&#0160;</em>recommends&#0160;<a href="https://amzn.to/31GnUHO">Free to Move: Foot Voting, Migration, and Political Freedom</a> by Ilya Somin.&#0160; Here is a description:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Ballot box voting is often considered the essence of political freedom. But it has two major shortcomings: individual voters have little chance of making a difference, and they also face strong incentives to remain ignorant about the issues at stake. &quot;Voting with your feet,&quot; however, avoids both of these pitfalls and offers a wider range of choices. In&#0160;<em>Free to Move</em>, Ilya Somin explains how broadening opportunities for foot voting can greatly enhance political liberty for millions of people around the world.<br /><br />People can vote with their feet through international migration, by choosing where to live within a federal system, and by making decisions in the private sector. These three types of foot voting are rarely considered together, but Somin explains how they have important common virtues and can be mutually reinforcing. He contends that all forms of foot voting should be expanded and shows how both domestic constitutions and international law can be structured to increase opportunities for foot voting while mitigating possible downsides.<br /><br />Somin addresses a variety of common objections to expanded migration rights, including claims that the &quot;self-determination&quot; of natives requires giving them the power to exclude migrants, and arguments that migration is likely to have harmful side effects, such as undermining political institutions, overburdening the welfare state, increasing crime and terrorism, and spreading undesirable cultural values. While these objections are usually directed at international migration, Somin shows how a consistent commitment to such theories would also justify severe restrictions on domestic freedom of movement. That implication is an additional reason to be skeptical of these rationales for exclusion. By making a systematic case for a more open world,&#0160;<em>Free to Move</em>&#0160;challenges conventional wisdom on both the left and the right.</p>
<p>And from the reviews:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;In this excellent book, Somin makes a compelling case that migration --or foot voting -- provides far more political power than voting. Any one voter has a trivially small chance of altering an election, but any household can choose a new state and local government by simply moving.This insight implies that devolving power to local governments will generate far more political voice than any conceivable reform to national elections. Freer international migration would empower even more people to choose their own government. Somin&#39;s case is strong, his thinking is clear, and his writing is eloquent.&quot; --&#0160;Edward Glaeser,&#0160; Professor of Economics, Harvard University, and author of&#0160;<em>The Triumph of the City</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />&quot;Ilya Somin shows that mobility-the freedom to move from here to there-might be the most underrated underpinning of a free society. It is especially important in America, where states can compete with one another to have social policies welcoming to enterprise and liberty.Voting is important; so is what Somin calls &#39;foot voting.&#39;&quot;--&#0160;George F. Will, columnist,&#0160;<em>Washington Post</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />&quot;This eminently readable, tightly-argued, and compelling book is a model for how empirically-informed democratic theory ought to proceed. Somin shows us that in modern democracies, even when everyone has equal voice, that voice is usually close to worthless. Taking political freedom seriously requires a serious solution: foot voting. We need to ensure everyone has the right and power to move and work where they please. Exit beats voice almost every time, and the competition isn&#39;t even close. Somin deftly considers and rebuts every major objection to his view. &quot;--&#0160;Jason Brennan, Georgetown University; author of&#0160;<em>The Ethics of Voting</em><br /><br />&quot;Ilya Somin has done it again, producing a compelling new book, rich with insights about democratic theory, law, and economics.&#0160;<em>Free to Move</em>&#0160;takes a familiar idea-that people should be allowed and encouraged to choose the entities that govern them by moving between jurisdictions-and shows why it is valuable and how taking it seriously as a form of political choice provides a clear set of answers to some of our most pressing social problems. Those who share Somin&#39;s belief in the value of &#39;voting with your feet,&#39; will see the scope of their commitment pushed by his consistency and range, and those who do not will find themselves challenged and perhaps even convinced.&quot;--&#0160;David Schleicher, Professor, Yale Law School</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />&quot;Many find majority voting...&#0160; to be the highest guarantor of liberty... Ilya Somin brilliantly and accessibly points to the central, additional role of&#0160;<em>voting with your feet....</em>&#0160;in protecting liberty.... [The] book&#0160; gives to common assumptions a taut and compelling challenge, and might leave you transformed. It offers a new way to think about international migration, but not just that. It is nothing less than a proposal for a higher form of democracy.&quot;&#0160;--&#0160;&#0160;Michael Clemens,&#0160;Center for Global Development, author of&#0160;<em>The Walls of Nations</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&#0160;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;It is the best book on geographic mobility and exit that has been written to date... I am happy to recommend it heartily.&quot;&#0160;--&#0160;Tyler Cowen,&#0160;<em>Marginal Revolution</em>, author of&#0160;<em>Stubborn Attachments</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&#0160;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;Somin offers a compelling and ingenious justification for free global movement.... The book&#39;s combination of rigorous thought and engaging argument makes &quot;Free to Move&quot; a must-read for those interested in the future of immigration law and policy.&quot; --&#0160;Peter Margulies,&#0160;<em>Lawfare</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&#0160;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;[T]he book&#39;s innovative arguments for federalism, zoning and occupational licensing reform, and openness to immigration are more important and timely than ever....<br />&#0160;&#0160;The author makes a compelling argument to expand foot voting in all its forms<em>.</em>&quot;<em>&#0160;--&#0160;</em>Daniel Griswold, Director of Trade and Immigration, Mercatus Center<em>,&#0160;The Bridge</em></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />&quot;Ilya Somin in his fine new book....&#0160; shows how foot voting may often be more effective than casting a ballot to bring about political change.&quot; --&#0160;John McGinnis, Northwestern University,&#0160;<em>Law &amp; Liberty</em></div>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Michael J. Klarman (Harvard University) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671830">Foreword: The Degradation of American Democracy—and the Court</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Foreword examines the recent degradation of American democracy, seeks explanations for it, and canvasses the Supreme Court’s contribution to it. Section IA examines the “autocrats’ playbook” to establish a baseline against which to evaluate recent American developments. Part IB considers President Trump’s authoritarian bent. Part IC describes the measures that Republicans have enacted in states to entrench themselves in power, including partisan gerrymandering, voter identification laws, purges of the voter rolls, measures to suppress the youth vote, circumvention of inconvenient voter initiatives, and even the delay and cancellation of elections. Part ID considers Republicans’ complicity with Trump, which has escalated over the course of his presidency, to the point that they mostly will not criticize him for obstructing the investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, politicizing law enforcement and intelligence, or catastrophically mishandling the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part II offers explanations for the nation’s current political predicament. Groups that fear becoming perpetual political losers may abandon their commitment to democracy, just as white southerners did in the antebellum period. Part IIA, “The Disappearing White Majority,” examines the role of demographic change, immigration, and increasing racial resentment in growing disaffection with democracy. Part IIB, “The Disappearing Christian Majority,” describes how the gradual collapse of the idea of the American “Christian nation” has contributed to such disaffection. Part IIC, “The Rise of the Neo-Ayn Randians,” considers how radical libertarians, never enthusiastic about democracy because of the threat it posed to property rights, gradually gained ideological and political influence since the 1960s and came to dominate the Republican Party. Part IID, “Economic Inequality,” explores how working-class Americans, whose economic position stopped improving about forty years ago, have become disaffected with a democratic political system that no longer works for them. Part IIE explains how these other developments, refracted through American political and media ecosystems, have produced a politics of asymmetric polarization, hardball, and negative partisanship, which created a Republican Party no longer strongly committed to democracy and prepared to defend at all costs a president with a strong authoritarian bent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part III examines the Supreme Court’s contributions to the degradation of American democracy. The Court’s conservatives abrogated the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, enabling Republican governments in the South to enact voting restrictions enabling the party to maintain political power in rapidly diversifying states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. The Court’s Republican Justices have also upheld stringent voter-identification laws and purges of the voter rolls, both of which purport to address the largely non-existent problem of voter fraud, while disfranchising Democratic-leaning constituencies, such as persons of color, the poor, and the young. Most recently, the conservative Justices have declined to intervene against partisan gerrymandering, which has mostly benefitted Republicans in recent years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Court’s campaign finance decisions, dating back to 1976 but becoming increasingly extreme over the last decade, have created a political system dominated by money, which advantages Republicans who disproportionately benefit from the political spending of the most affluent Americans. In Bush v. Gore (2000), the Court helped to elect a Republican president, who appointed two conservative Justices, without whose participation none of the recent rulings undermining democracy would have been possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In 2019, the conservative Justices fell one vote short of enabling Republicans to entrench themselves in power for another decade by ensuring that persons of color would be undercounted in the 2020 census. Only a last-minute change of heart by the Chief Justice stymied that effort. The conservative justices have also abjured the Court’s traditional role in protecting vulnerable racial and religious minorities from discrimination by validating the Trump administration’s thinly veiled ban on Muslim travel to the United States. Part III concludes by discussing how constitutional interpretation works in general and why the Republican majority’s rulings on issues of democratic governance nearly always benefit the Republican Party.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part IV briefly considers how to bolster American democracy. The best way to stem the degradation of democracy is to entrench democracy. Yet, this is an uphill battle, both because political actors who benefit from the status quo are incentivized to resist changes to it and because various structural features of the American political system advantage Republicans. To entrench democracy, Democrats would need to overcome simultaneously the disadvantages of partisan gerrymandering and geographic clustering in state legislatures and the House of Representatives, extreme malapportionment in the Senate, the vagaries and malapportionment of the electoral college, and the flood of unregulated political spending that the Court has unleashed. Even then, Republican Justices might invalidate democracy-entrenching measures. Moreover, some such measures, such as campaign-finance reform, may require a constitutional amendment, given the conservative Justices’ strained interpretations of the First Amendment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Court has a Republican majority today only because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat from Democrats in 2016, when he refused to permit President Obama to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The entrenchment of democracy will probably require Democrats to undo that theft.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A brief Conclusion examines competing reasons to be pessimistic and optimistic regarding prospects for stemming the degradation of American democracy, and reflects on the deeply contingent nature of this story’s outcome.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Jorge L. Contreras (University of Utah - S.J. Quinney College of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3675857">Expanding Access to Patents for COVID-19</a> (Burris, S., de Guia, S., Gable, L., Levin, D.E., Parmet, W.E., Terry, N.P. (Eds.) (2020). Assessing Legal Responses to COVID-19. Boston: Public Health Law Watch) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Two competing and linked sets of goals must be addressed when considering patent policy in response to a public health emergency. First is the allocation of existing resources among potential users (hospitals, patients, etc.); second is the creation of new technologies over time (innovation). Patents provide financial incentives to develop new technologies. Yet shortages of patented products often plague crisis response. In the case of COVID-19, allocative goals, particularly satisfying demand for patented medical products (e.g., vaccines, ventilators, PPE, and test kits), may be achieved through governmental interventions such as march-in and governmental use rights (compulsory licensing). But in cases involving the development of new technologies such as vaccines and therapies, incentive structures must be preserved to ensure that the private sector is appropriately motivated to act. In addition to patents, which reward inventors for financially successful innovations, a range of other incentives such as prizes, grants, and subsidies also exist to motivate technological innovation. Incentives like these, coupled with a requirement that resulting discoveries be made available on a broad and open basis, can achieve a balance between allocation and innovation goals. Governments can encourage such measures using both the incipient threat of compulsory licensing and the reward of procurement preferences and other up-front rewards.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>David Orentlicher (University of Nevada, Las Vegas, William S. Boyd School of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664952">Cruzan and Surrogate Decision-Making</a> (SMU Law Review, Vol. 73, No. 1, 2020, pages 155-162) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">When the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark “right to die” decision in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health thirty years ago, the dissenting Justices and many observers criticized the Court for rejecting a right of Nancy Cruzan’s parents to refuse medical care on her behalf. Ms. Cruzan had not written a living will or a durable power of attorney, nor did it appear that she had left clear oral instructions about her wishes. But she did have loving parents who were dedicated to doing what was best for her. Nevertheless, according to the Cruzan Court, “If the State were required by the United States Constitution to repose a right of ‘substituted judgment’ with anyone, the Cruzans would surely qualify. But we do not think the Due Process Clause requires the State to repose judgment on these matters with anyone but the patient herself.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This article argues that the Cruzan Court neglected an important justification for the right of patients to have medical decisions made for them by family members. If patients leave clear evidence of their treatment preferences, treatment must be based on those preferences. Similarly, if patients leave clear evidence that they would want a spouse or other family member to make medical decisions for them, the desired surrogate should be able to make medical decisions for the patient. A formal power of attorney appointment is an important way to provide clear evidence, and just as oral statements and other evidence can be used to establish the patient’s treatment preferences, so should oral statements and other evidence be able to establish the patient’s preferences for a surrogate decision-maker...</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Yahli Shereshevsky (Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Faculty of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681845">The Unintended Negative Effect of Positive Complementarity</a> (Journal of International Criminal Justice (JICJ) (Forthcoming, 2020))&#0160; on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Ending impunity cannot be achieved by international criminal tribunals alone. Therefore, it is important that states will take a significant part in these efforts. The principle of complementarity is aimed to incentivize states to conduct domestic criminal proceedings against alleged perpetrators of international crimes. This paper calls for a broader examination of the way in which the principle of complementarity incentivizes domestic actors. It argues that beyond the potential positive effect of complementarity on domestic criminal law, the shadow of the ICC creates a negative incentive for domestic courts to intervene in constitutional and administrative cases that examine general conduct of hostilities cases. The paper demonstrates this negative effect by examining a shift in the attitude of the Israeli Supreme Court in conduct of hostilities cases. In addition, the paper discusses the ways in which domestic courts attempt to regain their reputation following their increased deference in conduct of hostilities cases.</p>

				<p>Jenny E. Carroll (University of Alabama - School of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3678992">Beyond Bail</a> (Florida Law Review, Forthcoming) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">From the proliferation of community bail funds to the implementation of new risk assessment tools to the limitation and even eradication of money bail, reform movements have altered the landscape of pretrial detention. Yet little attention has been paid to the emerging reality of a post-money bail world. With monetary bail an unavailable or disfavored option, courts have come to rely increasingly on non-monetary conditions of release. These non-monetary conditions can be problematic for many of the same reasons that money bail is problematic and can inject additional bias into the pretrial system.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In theory, non-monetary conditions offer increased opportunities for release over monetary bail and can be narrowly tailored to accomplish specific goals. Yet the proposition that such non-monetary conditions accomplish their purported goals is untested and unsettled. Pretrial release conditions are often imposed at the conclusion of a remarkably brief pretrial hearing and in a near rote fashion, with little or no evidence that the condition is necessary to avoid the risk or risks that fuel them. Defendants – many of whom are unrepresented at these hearings – may be ill-equipped financially or otherwise to comply with such conditions. Non-compliance may place defendants at risk of either additional criminal charges or future pretrial detention.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article argues that the reduction or eradication of money bail alone has not and will not ensure a fair and unbiased system of pretrial detention, nor will it ensure that poor and marginal defendants will benefit from pretrial release. Rather, these reforms have shifted the burden of release from paying money bail to paying fees for a laundry list of pretrial release conditions. If pretrial detention reform is to achieve meaningful results, it must address not just the most apparent barrier to release – the fee charged in the form of bail – but all barriers that promote pretrial incarceration and impose unjustified burdens on defendants awaiting trial.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Mark L. Jones (Mercer University),&#0160;Cathren Koehlert-Page (Barry University - Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law),&#0160;Suzianne D. Painter-Thorne (Mercer University School of Law), &amp;&#0160;Gary J. Simson (Mercer University - Walter F. George School of Law; Cornell University - Law School) have posted&#0160;It’s <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3684190">Alright, Ma, It’s Life and Life Only: Are Colleges and Universities Legally Obligated during the Coronavirus Pandemic to Exempt High-Risk Faculty from In-Person Teaching Requirements?</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">After hurriedly transitioning to online learning when the coronavirus pandemic burst onto the scene during spring semester 2020, colleges and universities across the U.S. spent much of the spring and summer deciding how to proceed in the fall. Should all courses continue to be taught entirely online? Should all return to in person? Is the best answer instead some sort of hybrid curriculum? Because the pandemic has defied prediction at every turn, colleges and universities not going entirely online can’t help but know that at any point during the semester they may suddenly be forced to revisit and revise their decision. Furthermore, after a summer in which the virus continued to infect U.S. residents at an alarming rate, colleges and universities are surely on notice that the pandemic should figure front and center in their planning as they think about in-person vs. online instruction for spring semester 2021.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We believe that, for the duration of this pandemic, a college or university planning to offer any in-person classes has a moral obligation not to require any faculty members to teach in person who, out of concern for their own physical or emotional well-being or for that of another member of their household, ask to teach online instead. For now, however, we leave it to others to discuss more fully colleges’ and universities’ moral obligations. Our topic is colleges’ and universities’ legal obligations to allow faculty to opt for online, rather than in-person, teaching during this pandemic, and within that topic, we limit our focus to the group of faculty whom we believe colleges and universities have the clearest legal obligation to protect – those who, according to the criteria identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, appear to be most vulnerable to getting seriously ill or even dying if they contract the coronavirus. In the language of the CDC, our focus is faculty members “at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19” – a group that we call “CDC high-risk faculty.” According to the CDC, anyone is high risk who has reached age 65 or who has one of various specific medical conditions, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, hypertension, and more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">We outline various arguments that colleges and universities are legally obligated during this pandemic to exempt CDC high-risk faculty from any in-person teaching requirement. Two of the four legal sources upon which we rely are federal statutes that qualify as major statements of national policy – the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The other two sources are important state-law doctrines with strong support in the American Law Institute’s most recent restatement of the law of torts – protection from intentional infliction of physical harm, and protection from intentional infliction of emotional distress</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Our hope is that our arguments will provide college and university leaders with a perspective that will prompt them to recognize the great importance of adopting an exemption policy that at a minimum frees all CDC high-risk faculty from any requirement to teach in person. Perhaps they would adopt such a policy simply to avoid possible legal liability. Ideally, however, they would do so at least in part out of a recognition that a college or university policy at odds with legal sources as weighty as the four under discussion is a policy that speaks very poorly for the institutions they are charged with leading. The fact that it’s difficult to place a dollar value on a college’s or university’s reputation for fairness and humaneness doesn’t mean that a policy that tarnishes that reputation is not very costly to the institution. We have no doubt that it is.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Sergio Verdugo (Universidad del Desarrollo) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3660179">How Can Judges Challenge Dictators and Get Away With It?</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The literature on constitutional courts under authoritarian or hybrid regimes typically suggests that judges that decide to challenge a regime in high-stakes cases might face political backlashes. For that reason, some comparative constitutional law scholars argue that courts should develop strategies such as judicial avoidance or weak judicial review practices. This article claims that sometimes those strategies are unnecessary, as it is possible for courts, in specific high-stakes scenarios, to preserve or promote democratic values without facing such backlash. If there is a strategy that makes it feasible to reconcile:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(1) the need to advance a democratization agenda with</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(2) the necessity of safeguarding judicial independence, judges should prefer this later strategy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For this kind of strategy to be successful, judges need to identify and possibly predict the autocrats&#39; expected costs of disobeying the judicial decision. If the projected costs are high enough, dictators might prefer to obey the ruling.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">One way in which this judicial strategy can work is by triggering what the author calls &quot;Constitutional Paradox.&quot; This paradox is a dilemma that forces the dictators to decide whether to respect the rulings while supporting and enforcing the institutions they had established, or to disobey the unfavorable decisions while risking to divide the regime&#39;s supporting coalition, harming their credibility and weakening the legitimacy or authority of their institutions. The paradox raises the costs for ignoring those rulings, and those costs may be too high for the autocrats to accept. The article uses an example from the Chilean Pinochet dictatorship (1973-1990) to show how a constitutional paradox may be able to push dictators to respect such rulings, and it identifies the preliminary conditions in which a constitutional paradox can be triggered.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Shucheng Wang (City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) - Centre for Chinese &amp; Comparative Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3629969">Judicial Review of the Legislative Process in Hong Kong: A Comparative Perspective</a> (Shucheng Wang, “Judicial Review of the Legislative Process in Hong Kong: A Comparative Perspective” Statute Law Review (2020 Forthcoming)) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This article examines the deferential approach to judicial review of the legislative process as adopted by the Court of Final Appeal in Leung Kwok Hung v The President of Hong Kong Legislative Council. Through a comparative analysis, it explains that the underlying basis on which the doctrines of separation of powers and the parliamentary privilege of exclusive cognizance, and the corresponding principle of non-intervention, are significantly different in Hong Kong. Given Hong Kong’s semi-democratic system under the “one country, two systems” rubric, it argues for a less traditional allocation of power between the different institutions of government and a more assertive judiciary vis-à-vis the legislature. Moreover, it suggests the necessity of developing a human-rights-based approach to the adjudication concerning the non-intervention principle in order to maintain its common law system with liberal principles under the “one country, two systems” rubric.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Marla Tortorice (United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3660040">Nondelegation and the Major Questions Doctrine: Displacing Interpretive Power</a> (Buffalo Law Review Vol. 67, No. 4, 2019) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article deconstructs Justice Gorsuch’s non-delegation argument against Chevron deference and its subsequent manifestation in the Supreme Court as the major questions doctrine. It argues that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1) because a dispute in the constitutional interpretation of Chevron exists over the proper separation of powers, it is insufficient for Justice Gorsuch to claim to rely solely on a non-delegation argument to refute Chevron deference and</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2) the major questions doctrine acts more as a facade for the Court’s separation of power effort to diminish administrative power.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Both Justice Gorsuch and advocates of the major questions doctrine believe that the Court should be the entity to resolve statutory ambiguity — at the very least in cases that present significant questions. But in setting out the constitutional critique of Chevron, both Justice Gorsuch and the major questions doctrine, as a manifestation of the same criticism, offer a remedy that does not solve the problem of which their critique complains. It appears that the Court is now substituting the major questions doctrine for the traditional non-delegation doctrine to deal with what it believes are unconstitutional delegations by Congress. But the delegation is not being restored to the legislature. The result is a diminution of agency deference and an enhancement of the Courts’ interpretive role. This development, coupled with the fact that a legitimate dispute in the constitutional interpretation of Chevron exits, demonstrates that what really underlies the arguments over Chevron’s existence are policy disagreements over the proper role of the current administrative state.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">While other scholarly articles note that the enhancement of the Court’s own interpretive powers is one of the major questions doctrine’s ramifications, this Article is distinct in the depth in which it addresses this issue and in its argument against non-delegation as both a critique of Chevron and a rationale of the major questions doctrine.</p>

				<p>Richard D. Freer (Emory University School of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3675156">The Political Reality of Diversity Jurisdiction</a> (94 S. Cal. L. Rev. ___ (forthcoming 2021).) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Diversity of citizenship jurisdiction has been a staple of federal civil dockets since 1789. In the mid- to late-twentieth century, academics and some high-profile federal judges led a significant effort to abolish diversity jurisdiction. They were confident that diversity had outlived its purpose, which, they said, was to provide a federal court for out-of-state litigants who feared bias in the local state courts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">But diversity survived. Today, it represents a burgeoning percentage of the federal civil docket and is supported by an efficiency rationale that did not exist at the founding. Academics and judges seem relatively ambivalent toward, and even accepting of, this form of federal jurisdiction. We are in the midst of a resurgence of academic interest in diversity – not to abolish it, but to rationalize the various threads of its doctrine.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">These efforts should be informed by the lessons that should have been learned by those who sought to abolish diversity jurisdiction. First, diversity is not a free-standing phenomenon. It is part of a carefully constructed constitutional plan intended to promote the free flow of commerce and a national identity. Second, what is usually presented as the traditional justification for diversity is sclerotic and understates the value of diversity jurisdiction. Third, as a matter of political power, the bar embraces diversity jurisdiction and will fight to keep it. At one level, we retain diversity for raw political reason. But the bar’s embrace is important for another reason: it likely manifests rational choices made in the interests of litigation clients. At least, the embrace should spur meaningful study of the interests served by diversity jurisdiction (study that remains to be done). And that study must appreciate that, over two centuries, an elaborate legal culture has emerged concerning the relations of state and federal courts.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Paul B. Miller (Notre Dame Law School) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3665723">The Morality of Fiduciary Law</a> (62 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. (2021 Forthcoming)) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Recent work of fiduciary theory has provided conceptual synthesis requisite to understanding core fiduciary principles and the structure of fiduciary liability. However, normative questions have received only sporadic attention. What values animate fiduciary law? How does, or ought, fiduciary law prove responsive to them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Where in other areas of private law theory – notably, tort theory – pioneering scholars went directly at normative questions like these, fiduciary theory has been exceptional for the reticence shown toward them. The reticence is sensible. Fiduciary principles are the product of equity’s most extended and convoluted program of supplementing surrounding law. They span several distinct forms of relationship arising in markedly different settings.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In this article, I develop a framework for analysis of the morality of fiduciary law. The framework accomplishes four things. First, it situates questions about the morality of fiduciary law within the context of the general jurisprudential literature on the nature of law and its normativity. Second, it explains the sense in which fiduciary law is normatively complex by virtue of being structurally biplanar, with general equitable principles (duty-imposing rules) overlain upon legal and equitable principles (including, notably, power-conferring rules) that define and enable legal forms of relationship characterized as fiduciary in equity. Third, it distinguishes the general morality of fiduciary duties from the special morality of fiduciary relationship types. Fourth, and finally, it provides an overview of loci of value in fiduciary relationships, canvassing considerations of general and special morality that give salience to the interests of parties, third parties and the public in rules that enable and constrain the performance of fiduciary mandates.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The EU’s limited powers do not enable its institutions to effectively intervene in cases where Member State actions threaten fundamental values. The recent controversies emerging from some Member States’ human rights and rule of law backsliding turned this question to one of the core issues of the European project, calling for effective fundamental rights protection in the EU without suppressing national constitutional identities. Though EU law’s approach, at least at first glance, might appear to be idiosyncratic, it is far from unprecedented and, as far as multilevel constitutionalism is concerned, EU law may draw on the experiences of various regimes where centralized human rights protection and national or state constitutional identities coexist. This Article analyzes the current European approach as to the application of the federal bill of rights to states from a comparative perspective and explores the constitutional and jurisprudential patterns addressing the question of inquiry in a multilevel constitutional architecture. The Article analyzes the subject from a doctrinal, ontological, textual-conceptual, and institutional perspective with the aim of contributing to the current European debate with a new comparative perspective and fostering EU constitutional development with structural patterns. It submits that the currently prevailing paradigm of “scope” should be replaced or complemented with the paradigm of “core standards” and proposes a doctrine of European incorporation, arguing that the diagonally applicable rule of law and human rights requirements should be incorporated via Article 2 TEU to make them judicially applicable.</p>

				<p>Yaron Nili (University of Wisconsin Law School) &amp;&#0160;Megan W Shaner (University of Oklahoma College of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681578">Back the the Future? Reclaiming Shareholder Democracy Through Virtual Annual Meetings</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">From demanding greater executive accountability to lobbying for social and environmental policies, shareholders today influence how managers run American corporations. In theory, shareholders exert that influence through the annual meeting: a forum where any shareholder, large or small, can speak their mind, engage with the corporation’s directors and managers, and influence each other. But today’s annual meetings, where a widely diffused group of owners often vote by proxy, are largely pro forma: only handful of shareholders attend the meeting and voting results are largely determined prior to the meeting. In many cases, this leaves Main Street investors’ voice unspoken for.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">But modern technology has the potential to resurrect the annual meeting as the deliberative convocation and touchstone of shareholder democracy it once was. COVID-19 has forced most American corporations to hold their annual meetings virtually. Virtual meetings allow shareholders to attend meetings at a low cost, holding the promise of re-engaging retail shareholders in corporate governance. If structured properly, virtual meetings can reinvigorate the annual meeting, reviving shareholder democracy while maintaining the efficiency benefits of proxy voting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Article makes three key contributions to the existing literature. First, using a comprehensive hand collected dataset of state reactions to COVID-19 and of all annual meetings held between March 11 and June 30, 2020, it offers a detailed empirical account of the impact that COVID-19 and the move to virtual annual meetings had on shareholder voting. Second, it uses the context of COVID-19 to show how modern-day annual meetings have drifted away from its democratic function. Finally, the Article argues that technology can revive the shareholder democracy goals of annual meetings, and underscores how virtual meetings can meet that important goal.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This symposium piece is a response to Professor Nathalie Martin&#39;s Bringing Relevance Back to Consumer Bankruptcy. This response overviews the place consumer bankruptcy presently occupies in the United States. In doing so, it details why consumer bankruptcy remains relevant in the face of a socio-economic structure and of laws that suggest that bankruptcy may not be a particularly useful place for struggling Americans to turn to for help. The response ends by calling for a bolder vision for consumer bankruptcy in light of the shifting place of the bankruptcy system in America’s increasingly thread-bare social safety net.</p>

				<p>Howell E. Jackson (Harvard Law School) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3659500">A System of Fiduciary Protections for Mutual Funds</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The regulation of mutual funds in the United States arguably contains the world’s most extensive system of fiduciary protection, buttressed by elaborate liability rules and a host of procedural protections and mandatory disclosure requirements designed to facilitate investor protection and choice. The intensity of this regulatory structure is a subject of perennial debate, as public officials and policy analysts attempt to balance the cost of compliance and oversight against benefits to investors. Over time, government officials have made numerous supervisory accommodations to ameliorate the system’s costs and facilitate industry innovations. But, the burdens of this enhanced system of fiduciary protections for mutual funds remain significant and have encouraged industry participants to evade these legal requirements in a number of ways, such as the creation of alternative vehicles for collective investments (including insurance products and managed accounts of various sorts) and the imbedding of regulated mutual funds into other legal structures that escape the full application of the enhanced systemic of fiduciary protections for mutual funds. Technological innovations, such as robo-advising, are likely to accelerate this trend. In this chapter, I explore this important illustration of regulatory arbitrage and suggest areas where aspects of mutual fund regulation might appropriately be extended to functionally similar investment vehicles.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Matthew A. Shapiro (Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey - Rutgers Law School) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3675848">Distributing Civil Justice</a> (Georgetown Law Journal, Forthcoming) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">With growing economic inequality, questions of distributive justice have become increasingly prominent in legal scholarship, particularly public law scholarship. Civil procedure scholarship has been no exception, traditionally addressing such questions under the heading of “access to justice.” And yet, despite the ubiquity of the phrase, discussions of access to justice have tended to focus almost exclusively on how procedural resources and opportunities should be distributed and, accordingly, who should receive any given share of those resources and opportunities. Much less attention has been paid to what, exactly, is being distributed — which specific goods access to justice actually comprises. Perhaps because of this vagueness, proponents of access to justice have coalesced around a fairly stable set of policy positions on a wide range of procedural issues.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article shows that apparent consensus to be much less secure than scholars commonly assume. Only by abstracting from the specific goods associated with access to justice can scholars achieve such widespread agreement about which procedural rules and policies accord with distributive justice. In fact, scholars allude to multiple distinct goods when advocating broad access to justice. Though often treated as interchangeable or even synonymous, those goods, once distinguished, turn out to entail potentially conflicting implications for some of the doctrinal and policy issues that currently preoccupy civil procedure scholars, complicating the standard access-to-justice position on each one. Whether a particular policy promotes access to justice and satisfies the demands of distributive justice depends on which specific goods we’re trying to facilitate access to. The unadorned concept of access to justice doesn’t have the fully determinate, unidirectional policy valence that many scholars suppose it to have.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The problem, moreover, runs much deeper than just an ambiguity about the aims of civil justice. For the different goods associated with access to justice can be traced to different — and often conflicting — functions of the modern liberal state. Such conflicts are fundamental, going to the core of liberalism, and so are no more likely to be definitively resolved in civil procedure than in any other context. That being the case, we should expose and acknowledge the conflicts between different procedural (and political) goals and restructure procedural rule-making institutions to better negotiate them, rather than imagine that blunt appeals to access to justice alone can determine civil procedure’s proper response to increasing economic inequality. We shouldn’t expect the task of determining the legal implications of economic inequality to be any more straightforward — or any less contentious — in civil procedure than it has been in public law. And public law, for its part, may end up having to make some of the same kinds of difficult trade-offs that civil procedure scholars have been loath to confront.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Etienne Toussaint (UDC David A. Clarke School of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3683281">Blackness as Fighting Words</a> (106 Va. L. Rev. Online (Forthcoming 2020)) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The resurgence of worldwide protests by activists of the Movement for Black Lives (BLM) has ushered a global reckoning with the meaning of this generation’s rallying cry – “Black Lives Matter.” As citizens emblazon their streets with this expression in massive artistic murals, the Trump administration has responded with the militarized policing of non-violent public demonstrations, revealing not merely a disregard for public safety, but far worse, a concerted dismantling of protestors’ First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, BLM protests have persisted. Accordingly, this Essay considers the implications of this generation’s acclamation of Black humanity amidst the social tensions exposed during the era of COVID-19. What does the Trump administration’s militarized response to BLM protests mean in a world mutilated by the scars of racial oppression, a wound laid bare by America’s racially biased, aggressive, and supervisory culture of policing?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In response, much in the way Cheryl Harris revealed Whiteness as Property, this Essay suggests and defends Black identity itself, or Blackness – whether articulated by the pure speech of racial justice activists who affirm Black humanity, or embodied by the symbolic speech of Black bodies assembled in collective dissent in the public square – as “fighting words” in the consciousness of America, a type of public speech unprotected by the Constitution. The very utterance of the phrase “Black Lives Matter” tends to incite imminent violence and unbridled rage from police in city streets across America. Discussions of “Black Lives Matter” by pundits conjure images of subversion, disorder, and looting, the racialized narratives of social unrest commonly portrayed by the media. Yet, the words “Black Lives Matter” and the peaceful assembly of Black protestors also encapsulate the fire of righteous indignation burning in the hearts of minoritized citizens. This dynamic reflects unresolved tensions in the First Amendment’s treatment of race relations in America. Even more, it exposes the role of policing in smothering the Constitutional rights of Black and Brown citizens.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Essay provides three contributions to the ongoing discourse on policing in the United States. First, it reveals how unresolved racial tensions in the First Amendment – focusing specifically on ambiguities in the fighting words doctrine – perpetuate the racially biased, aggressive, and supervisory culture of American policing. Second, it analyzes how such unresolved racial tensions cast a dark shadow over the liberty of Black and Brown citizens who experience racism at the hands of police officers, yet avoid acts of protest for fear of bodily harm or arrest. Third, it illuminates the embeddedness of racism in American policing culture, more generally; a culture that not only constructs and reconstitutes the racial social order, but also degrades the dignity of Black and Brown citizens. Collectively, these insights lend support toward demands for police abolition from BLM activists. As this Essay concludes, until we as a nation wrestle with the unresolved racial subtext of modern policing – a racist culture woven into law that not only silences the legitimate protests of minoritized citizens in violation of their First Amendment rights, but also rationalizes callous violence at the hands of law enforcement – Black America will remain a peril to the veil of white supremacy that looms over the American constitutional order.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Do people believe a federal court when it rules against the government? And does such judicial credibility depend on the perceived political affiliation of the judge? This study presents a survey experiment addressing these questions, based on a set of recent cases in which both a judge appointed by President George W. Bush and a judge appointed by President Bill Clinton declared the same Trump Administration action to be unlawful. The findings offer evidence that, in a politically salient case, the partisan identification of the judge — here, as a “Bush judge” or “Clinton judge” — can influence the credibility of judicial review in the public mind.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Michael J. Klarman (Harvard University) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671830">Foreword: The Degradation of American Democracy—and the Court</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Foreword examines the recent degradation of American democracy, seeks explanations for it, and canvasses the Supreme Court’s contribution to it. Section IA examines the “autocrats’ playbook” to establish a baseline against which to evaluate recent American developments. Part IB considers President Trump’s authoritarian bent. Part IC describes the measures that Republicans have enacted in states to entrench themselves in power, including partisan gerrymandering, voter identification laws, purges of the voter rolls, measures to suppress the youth vote, circumvention of inconvenient voter initiatives, and even the delay and cancellation of elections. Part ID considers Republicans’ complicity with Trump, which has escalated over the course of his presidency, to the point that they mostly will not criticize him for obstructing the investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, politicizing law enforcement and intelligence, or catastrophically mishandling the federal government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part II offers explanations for the nation’s current political predicament. Groups that fear becoming perpetual political losers may abandon their commitment to democracy, just as white southerners did in the antebellum period. Part IIA, “The Disappearing White Majority,” examines the role of demographic change, immigration, and increasing racial resentment in growing disaffection with democracy. Part IIB, “The Disappearing Christian Majority,” describes how the gradual collapse of the idea of the American “Christian nation” has contributed to such disaffection. Part IIC, “The Rise of the Neo-Ayn Randians,” considers how radical libertarians, never enthusiastic about democracy because of the threat it posed to property rights, gradually gained ideological and political influence since the 1960s and came to dominate the Republican Party. Part IID, “Economic Inequality,” explores how working-class Americans, whose economic position stopped improving about forty years ago, have become disaffected with a democratic political system that no longer works for them. Part IIE explains how these other developments, refracted through American political and media ecosystems, have produced a politics of asymmetric polarization, hardball, and negative partisanship, which created a Republican Party no longer strongly committed to democracy and prepared to defend at all costs a president with a strong authoritarian bent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part III examines the Supreme Court’s contributions to the degradation of American democracy. The Court’s conservatives abrogated the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act, enabling Republican governments in the South to enact voting restrictions enabling the party to maintain political power in rapidly diversifying states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. The Court’s Republican Justices have also upheld stringent voter-identification laws and purges of the voter rolls, both of which purport to address the largely non-existent problem of voter fraud, while disfranchising Democratic-leaning constituencies, such as persons of color, the poor, and the young. Most recently, the conservative Justices have declined to intervene against partisan gerrymandering, which has mostly benefitted Republicans in recent years.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Court’s campaign finance decisions, dating back to 1976 but becoming increasingly extreme over the last decade, have created a political system dominated by money, which advantages Republicans who disproportionately benefit from the political spending of the most affluent Americans. In Bush v. Gore (2000), the Court helped to elect a Republican president, who appointed two conservative Justices, without whose participation none of the recent rulings undermining democracy would have been possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In 2019, the conservative Justices fell one vote short of enabling Republicans to entrench themselves in power for another decade by ensuring that persons of color would be undercounted in the 2020 census. Only a last-minute change of heart by the Chief Justice stymied that effort. The conservative justices have also abjured the Court’s traditional role in protecting vulnerable racial and religious minorities from discrimination by validating the Trump administration’s thinly veiled ban on Muslim travel to the United States. Part III concludes by discussing how constitutional interpretation works in general and why the Republican majority’s rulings on issues of democratic governance nearly always benefit the Republican Party.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Part IV briefly considers how to bolster American democracy. The best way to stem the degradation of democracy is to entrench democracy. Yet, this is an uphill battle, both because political actors who benefit from the status quo are incentivized to resist changes to it and because various structural features of the American political system advantage Republicans. To entrench democracy, Democrats would need to overcome simultaneously the disadvantages of partisan gerrymandering and geographic clustering in state legislatures and the House of Representatives, extreme malapportionment in the Senate, the vagaries and malapportionment of the electoral college, and the flood of unregulated political spending that the Court has unleashed. Even then, Republican Justices might invalidate democracy-entrenching measures. Moreover, some such measures, such as campaign-finance reform, may require a constitutional amendment, given the conservative Justices’ strained interpretations of the First Amendment.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Court has a Republican majority today only because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stole a Supreme Court seat from Democrats in 2016, when he refused to permit President Obama to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The entrenchment of democracy will probably require Democrats to undo that theft.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">A brief Conclusion examines competing reasons to be pessimistic and optimistic regarding prospects for stemming the degradation of American democracy, and reflects on the deeply contingent nature of this story’s outcome.</p>

Jackson (Harvard Law School) &amp;&#0160;Paul Rothstein (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) have posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3659474">The Analysis of Benefits in Consumer Protection Regulation</a> (Harvard Business Law Review, Vol. 9, Page 199, 2019) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Over the past decade, cost-benefit analysis in the field of financial regulation (“financial CBA”) has emerged as a topic of intense public interest. In reviewing rulemakings under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts have demanded greater rigor in the financial CBA that regulators provide in support of new regulations. Industry experts and other analysts have repeatedly questioned the adequacy of agency assessments of costs and benefits. And legal academics have engaged in a robust dialogue over the merits of financial CBA and the value of alternative institutional structures for overseeing financial CBA.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article adds to the expanding literature on financial CBA by offering a detailed study of how regulatory agencies actually undertake benefit analysis in promulgating new regulations involving matters of consumer finance and other analogous areas of consumer protection. After a brief literature review, the Article proposes a taxonomy for categorizing benefit analysis in the area of consumer financial regulation. This taxonomy reflects traditional market failures, cognitive limitations of consumers, as well as several other beneficial outcomes commonly associated with regulations designed to protect consumers. Taking the taxonomy as a framework, the Article then reports on a detailed survey of seventy-two consumer protection regulations adopted in recent years, and presents an overview of the range and quality of benefit analysis that government officials actually undertook in the surveyed regulations. The Article next provides a more detailed discussion of twenty “exemplars” of benefit analysis drawn from regulations in the sample and focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of what might be considered state-of-the-art benefit analysis in consumer protection regulation in the years immediately following the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Article concludes with a discussion of potential lines of academic research and institutional reform that might assist financial regulators in conducting more complete benefit analysis for consumer protection regulation in the future.</p>

				<p>R. George Wright (Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1010696">Homelessness and the Missing Constitutional Dimension of Fraternity</a> (Louisville Law Review, Forthcoming) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Article seeks to deepen our understanding of the lack of constitutional protection against long-term involuntary homelessness. There are a number of powerful moral justifications for constitutionally addressing homelessness, but the lack of any constitutional response continues. It has been observed often that the Constitution emboides mainly negative, as opposed to positive, rights, or rights prohibiting government interference rather than rights requiring some costly government provision. But underlying this kind of explanation is the fact that our constitutional focus on rights, and on liberty and equality in particular, is actually part of the problem. Homelessness is certainly linked in various ways to lack of liberty and equality, but as the Article argues, liberty and equality carefully understood are not central to the most crucial dimensions of homelessness. Homelessness is actually more precisely a problem of lack of fraternity, or solidarity, than of liberty or equality. Our Constitution, however, follows the French Revolution slogan in emphasizing liberty and equality, but not fraternity, to the detriment of the homeless. The Article tracks the welcome but inevitably inadequate litigation on behalf of the homeless in the absence of constitutional fraternity, and considers finally some problems of implementation that are in principle resolvable in the presence of genuine fraternity.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Christopher Heath Wellman’s Rights Forfeiture and Punishment is an engaging and carefully written book. It is provocative and challenging. In Wellman’s words this book provides neither a complete account of punishment nor an exhaustive theory of criminal law. More modestly, it seeks to articulate and defend a particular version of forfeiture theory, and then to explore some of this theory’s more striking implications for criminal law (p. 9). I disagree with Wellman’s humble description of his work --the book is much more than that. Wellman attempts to solve many of the most difficult problems in the philosophy of criminal law. I have reservations about many of his conclusions and many of his points of view appear to be underdeveloped. However, I will not draw attention here to what Wellman should have said or to authors whom he should have discussed. In this limited space I will present a sketch of the book and some of the discussions presented by Wellman.</p>

				<p>Andrew Halpin (National University of Singapore (NUS) - Faculty of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3659508">No-Right and its Correlative</a> (Forthcoming, (2020) 65 American Journal of Jurisprudence) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Disagreement and confusion have beset Hohfeld’s no-right from its emergence over a hundred years ago until present times, with recent important contributions to the discussion coming from Heidi Hurd and Michael Moore, and Matthew Kramer. This article aims to dispel the confusion over no-right by drawing attention to three straightforward points, and by providing a more careful examination of a neglected source of complexity associated with liberty as the correlative of no-right. The straightforward points emerge from consideration of the practical significance of a no-right as both a negation and a correlative within Hohfeld’s scheme; the important difference between the practical significance of a normative position and the theoretical status of the concept representing that position; and, the relationship between logical duals and contradictories as applied to normative positions. The scene is then set for working through the complexity associated with liberty as the correlative of no-right. This involves recognizing a connection between the normative positions of Hohfeld’s analytical scheme and the deontic operators of deontic logic. The conventional interdefinability of permission and obligation within deontic logic is challenged here. The conclusion is reached that “liberty” is an inadequate label for the normative position signifying the absence of duty; and that, as a distinctive position, liberty is not a true correlative of any other normative position. Implications are noted for the theoretical problem faced by deontic logic when confronting a normative system comprising relations between individuals, and for the solution of practical problems within a (legal or moral) normative system, where no-rights and liberties are to be found.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Tamar Hostovsky Brandes (Ono Academic College Faculty of Law) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3682992">Constitutionalism and Social Solidarity: A Theoretical and Comparative Analysis</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In the face of the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Solidarity has become the term of the hour. The World Health Organization organized a “solidarity series of events”, under the hashtag “together at home”, and chose the title “Solidarity” for the ambitious global initiative to find a treatment to the virus, establishing a “Solidarity” response fund. Within countries, solidarity was raised as a value requiring the imposition of various social distancing measures and limitations, needed, it was argued, in order to protect both society as a whole, as well as individuals who were especially vulnerable to the virus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The different approaches taken by countries in responding to the COVID-19 crisis can, in part, be explained by the different social perceptions regarding the importance of social solidarity and the duties that stem from it. The notion of solidarity, explored below, underlies the web of mutual commitments among members of a community, and, in the case of states, among members of the political community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This article examines the role solidarity can play when recognized as a constitutional value. Narratives of solidarity are prevalent in constitutions world-wide, both implicitly and explicitly. Despite this prevalence, constitutional scholarship has payed relatively little attention to the notion of solidarity. The article aims to take a step in filling this gap. It calls for recognition and discussion of the significance, potential and perils of recognizing solidarity as a constitutional value and of applying it in constitutional adjudication.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The article argues that despite the liberal aversion of the notion of solidarity, which is understandable in light of potential abuses of the concept to justify limitations of individual freedom, solidarity is a precondition for the existence of just societies and for distributive justice, as well as for ensuring that human rights are equally and inclusively realized.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The article argues that the relationship between collective identity and solidarity is complex, that solidarity is a multi-layered phenomenon, and that these complexities can and should be reflected in the constitutional manifestation of solidarity. Constitutions do and should refer to more than one layer of solidarity, and courts can and should play a part in instilling substance in these layers. Where solidarity is recognizing as a value, it can serve to examine the effect of laws and policies on under-privileged members of society, and as a source for deriving duties towards them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Finally, the article argues that although constitutional solidarity may intuitively be expected to endorse only intra-state solidarity, that is, solidarity among members of the political community, constitutions can and do endorse notions of transnational solidarity. The article argues that constitutionalism can thus be an important source of “bottom-up” transnational and global solidarity. </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Timothy Kelly (Temple Law) has posted <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3657346">The Third Restatement and the Jurisprudential Evolution of Duty: Tracking the &#39;Duty War&#39; in Palsgraf and Beyond</a> (Drexel Law Review, 2020) on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The paper is about the jurisprudential evolution of the concept of duty from the early times of Blackstone, Austin, and Holmes, through each of the three Restatements of Torts, and up to the present day. I frame this history using the Palsgraf debate between Justice Cardozo and Judge Andrews as a touchstone for analysis. Although past Restatements endorsed the “relational” view of duty associated with Cardozo (which can be traced back to Blackstone), the recent Restatement (Third) of Torts endorses a non-relational, “social” view of duty associated with Andrews (which can be traced back to Austin and Holmes).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">I discuss the jurisprudential history leading up to this reversal by the Restatement, as well as the reception of the third Restatement since publication. I argue that recent critiques of the third Restatement are unpersuasive, but that the third Restatement nonetheless shows little hope of resolving the duty debate. While acknowledging disputes about the third Restatement’s doctrinal merits, I focus more on Professors John Goldberg and Ben Zipursky’s yet-unscrutinized philosophical claim that H.L.A. Hart’s “internal” view of law favors their relational theory of duty and so bolsters the argument against the third Restatement’s social duty theory. I reject that novel argument, explaining that Professors Goldberg and Zipursky misunderstand Hart, whose jurisprudence is in fact no more or less hospitable to either theory of duty. This observation supports my overarching conclusion that the third Restatement, despite its merit, will not be able to convert committed relational duty theorists to the social duty theory and that the debate over duty shows no sign of stopping.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This article, a contribution to a symposium inspired by Brian Tamanaha’s recent book, A Realistic Theory of Law, applies Husserl’s phenomenology to jurisprudential issues regarding universal principles of law. It argues that there are no such principles. The principles by which we formulate our legal, as well as our moral, judgments are the product of our own society, and exist within the horizon of our conceptual framework. What we claim as universal principles are simply rhetorical devices that exist within that framework. This does not preclude us from advancing legal or moral arguments; rather, it determines the factors that will render such arguments meaningful and convincing to us.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">If we want to understand the legal systems of other cultures, we must do so by means of careful study and constant awareness of our differences. Reference to universal principles can be considered a type of intellectual colonialism, leading to distortion and misunderstanding of those other legal systems. The search for universal principles also leads to distortion and misunderstanding of our own legal system, which –like the legal systems of more recently colonized nations -- originated from a wide range of sources and continues to be a mélange of inconsistent legal rules. Quite often, universal legal principles are invoked to condemn our dominant form of governance, which is an administrative state. But that form of governance reflects our conception of law, and condemnations based on universal principles are merely specific, ideologically-based criticisms within our legal discourse that try to dress up those criticisms with invalidly grandiose terminology.</p>

				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>One approach to the meaning of language emphasizes the idea that meaning is conventional. &#0160;Thus, when we interpret a constitutional or statutory provision, we might like for the conventional semantic meaning of the word or phrase. &#0160;But there is another view in the philosophy of language that rejects the idea that all meaning is conventional. &#0160;This approach has its greatest intuitive appeal in the case of words like &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;water&quot; that refer to natural kinds. &#0160;Thus gold is the name of an element with an atomic structure, and water is the name for a substance defined by a molecular structure (H20).</p>
<p>The idea of natural kinds that have an essential structure could be extended to what might be called &quot;moral kinds&quot; or &quot;functional kinds.&quot; &#0160;Thus it could be argued that legal concepts like &quot;cruelty,&quot; &quot;guilt,&quot; &quot;reasonableness,&quot; or &quot;causation&quot; are not defined conventionally, but instead have an essence that defines their true nature.</p>
<p>This entry in the&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Lexicon</em> provides a very short introduction to the idea of natural and moral kinds. &#0160;As always, the&#0160;<em>Lexicon&#0160;</em>is aimed at law students with an interest in legal theory.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Kinds</strong></p>
<p>A conventional approach to language might lead to the conclusion that a word like &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;water&quot; has whatever meaning is revealed by the patterns of usage that establish its conventional meaning, but there is a powerful argument that this is not the case. &#0160;Gold and water are natural kinds, the nature of which can be determined by scientific investigation. &#0160;Whether something really is gold or water doesn&#39;t depend on the way we talk, it depends on physics and chemistry. &#0160;A famous example is &quot;jade,&quot; which was once thought to be a single substance. &#0160;When modern science revealed that what we had been calling &quot;jade&quot; was actually two different substances (&quot;jade&quot; and &quot;jadeite&quot;), we learned that we had been making a mistake when we called jadeite &quot;jade.&quot;</p>
<p>The idea of natural kinds was developed by philosophers. &#0160;The key figures are Saul Kripke and Hilary Putnam. &#0160;Some of their writings are cited in the bibliography below.</p>
<p>Natural kind terms play a role in the law, but that role is limited. &#0160;For example, the United States Constitution refers to gold and silver in Article One. &#0160;If these substances are natural kinds, then their meaning in the constitutional text might be determined by the best scientific theory of their nature. &#0160;But the law frequently uses terms that do not refer to natural kinds that are investigated by science. &#0160;Examples might include &quot;unreasonable&quot; in the Fourth Amendment, &quot;cruel&quot; in the Eighth Amendment, or &quot;freedom of speech&quot; in the First Amendment.</p>
<p><strong>Moral and Functional Kinds</strong></p>
<p>The existence of natural kinds with essences that are revealed by natural science is relatively uncontroversial. &#0160;More controversial is the idea that there might be moral or functional kinds. &#0160;If this idea is correct that it would have important implications for the interpretation of legal texts. &#0160;When judges were trying to determine what is &quot;unreasonable&quot; they would investigate the nature of reasonableness; the best theory of what is reasonable would then guide the determination of what searches are &quot;unreasonable&quot; for Fourth Amendment purposes. &#0160;Likewise, judges interpreting the First Amendment would try to determine the true nature of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and then apply that theory to determine what constitutes a violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>This idea has been most extensively developed by the great legal philosopher Michael Moore; his most important article on the notion of functional kinds and its role in legal interpretation&#0160;is cited in the bibliography that appears below. &#0160;Moore&#39;s idea is very different that the use of the concept-conception distinction by Ronald Dworkin: that notion is explored in a separate&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Lexicon&#0160;</em>entry.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The notion of natural kinds and the related ideas of moral and functional kinds pose an important challenge to conventionalist accounts of legal interpretation. &#0160;This is a deep topic, but my hope is that this&#0160;<em>Lexicon</em> entry provides a basic introduction that is accessible to students without background in philosophy.</p>

				<p>The&#0160;<em>Legal Theory Bookworm&#0160;</em>recommends <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z2q9DV">Beyond Belief, Beyond Conscience: The Radical Significance of the Free Exercise of Religion</a> by Jack N. Rakove.&#0160; Here is a description:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Today, Americans believe that the early colonists came to the New World in search of religious liberty. What we often forget is that they wanted religious liberty for themselves, not for those who held other views that they rejected and detested. Yet, by the mid-18th century, the colonists agreed that everyone possessed a sovereign right of conscience. How did this change develop? In&#0160;<em>Beyond Belief, Beyond Conscience</em>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jack Rakove tracks the unique course of religious freedom in America.<br /><br />He finds that, as denominations and sects multiplied, Americans became much more tolerant of the free expression of rival religious beliefs. During the Revolutionary era, he explains, most of the new states moved to disestablish churches and to give constitutional recognition to rights of conscience. These two developments explain why religious freedom originally represented the most radical right of all. No other right placed greater importance on the moral autonomy of individuals, or better illustrated how the authority of government could be limited by denying the state authority to act. Together, these developments made possible the great revival of religion in 19th-century America.<br /><br />As Rakove explains, America&#39;s intense religiosity eventually created a new set of problems for mapping the relationship between church and state. He goes on to examine some of our contemporary controversies over church and state not from the vantage point of legal doctrine, but of the deeper history that gave the U.S. its own approach to religious freedom. In this book, he tells the story of how American ideas of religious toleration and free exercise evolved over time, and why questions of church and state still vex us.</p>
<p>And from the reviews:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;A worthwhile look at a freedom too often taken for granted.&quot; --<em>Kirkus</em><br /><br />&quot;Prize-winning historian Jack Rakove&#39;s lucid narrative of how the US Constitution came to acknowledge religion&#39;s role in private conscience and public policy brings out the complex religious and intellectual history underlying the development of constitutional doctrine. Rakove shows that a historian&#39;s ability to provide context for the way in which successive generations have treated religion in public law can illuminate contemporary controversies and provide &#39;lessons worth pondering,&#39; even though history cannot, as Rakove carefully notes, provide the only firm grounding for the decisions we must make today.&quot; --Mark Tushnet, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law, Harvard Law School; author of&#0160;<em>Taking Back the Constitution</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;Original and illuminating! Jack Rakove paints a vivid portrait of Madison and Jefferson, driven by Enlightenment ideas, acting to disestablish state religion and construct our contemporary notion of religious freedom. Moving elegantly across the Atlantic and through the centuries, Rakove explains how constitutional rights of individual religious conscience and private, voluntary association replaced the far more limited concept of state toleration of religious dissent. The final chapters boldly attempt to integrate this now familiar, once revolutionary concept into our world of expanded government, wide religious pluralism, and elaborate judicial doctrine.&quot; --Ira C. Lupu, F. Elwood and Eleanor Davis Professor Emeritus of Law, George Washington University; co-author of&#0160;<em>Secular Government, Religious People</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&quot;With characteristically sharp insight and good humor, Rakove traces the American history of religious freedom from colonization to today. This wonderful book presents the familiar combination of free exercise and non-establishment as the remarkable and unlikely innovation it was. And as Rakove&#39;s expert telling shows: it is all the more precious for that.&quot; --Teresa Bejan, Associate Professor of Political Theory, University of Oxford; author of&#0160;<em>Mere Civility</em></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Kevin P. Tobia (Georgetown University Law Center) has posted&#0160;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3680107">Experimental Jurisprudence</a> on SSRN.&#0160; Here is the abstract:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“Experimental jurisprudence” is a novel empirical approach to jurisprudence. This practice has grown into a movement, as scholars increasingly conduct experimental-jurisprudential studies of legal concepts including causation, consent, intent, knowledge and reasonableness. Despite clear progress, the approach’s justification is still surprisingly opaque. To put it most provocatively: Jurisprudence is the study of deep and longstanding theoretical questions about law’s nature, but “experimental jurisprudence” simply surveys laypeople. Experimental jurisprudence seems to miss the mark on two counts. First, the wrong group: Laypeople—with no legal expertise—are a strange population to survey about legal criteria of causation or consent. Second, the is-ought fallacy: Even if surveys of laypeople tell us something about what law is, they do not tell us what law should be.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This Essay fills this justificatory gap, providing an articulation and defense of experimental jurisprudence. It argues that although jurisprudence is often considered the domain of legal experts, experimental surveys of laypeople provide crucial and unique insights. Moreover, the collection of this empirical data can, in fact, contribute to normative jurisprudential debates. The Essay concludes by arguing that once experimental jurisprudence is appropriately understood, it becomes clear that the practice is not merely consistent with the aims of traditional jurisprudence; it is actually an essential branch of jurisprudence.</p>
